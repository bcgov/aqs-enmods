"BCCABIN","BC Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network Program","Provincial biomonitoring program managed by ENV in collaboration with ECCC. Program Contact: Madison.Wassick@gov.bc.ca.","Maintain and update CABIN models by sampling 10% of reference sites annually in collaboration with ECCC. Water chemistry (field measurements, nutrients, major ions, metals, TSS) and benthic macroinvertebrate samples (three-minute kick method) are collected annually at select reference sites. Results from these samples, in addition to stream and habitat field measurements are used to assess the ecological health and condition of streams across BC.","Government Monitoring"
"BCLMN","BC Lake Monitoring Network","Biannual long-term water quality trend sampling of key lakes across the province. Program contact Mike.Sokal@gov.bc.ca","The primary purpose of the BCLMN is to determine current water quality status and understand long-term trends of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of B.C. lakes. This information, can then be used to assess lake water quality in relation to ecosystem change, including watershed stressors and climate change. Lakes encompass numerous BEC zones, and span wide gradients of area, depth, elevation, land use, and trophic status.","Government Monitoring"
"BCLSMP","BC Lake Stewardship and Monitoring Program","Citizen Science based Provincial lake monitoring program managed by ENV in collaboration with the BC Lake Stewardship Society. Program contact Kirsten.McNeill@gov.bc.ca.","Regular multi-depth sampling for nutrients (P) and biological indicators (Chl-a) during the ice-free season to determine trophic status and lake health. Lakes monitored for 3 consecutive years on a rotational basis, pending volunteer availability/interest.","Government Monitoring"

"PGOWN","Provincial Groundwater Observation Well Network","Opportunistic groundwater quality sampling. Program contact Bryan.Jackson@gov.bc.ca","The Provincial Groundwater Observation Well Network (PGOWN) conducts long-term monitoring of groundwater levels across British Columbia. In addition, groundwater samples are periodically collected from established stations. The PGOWN installs, maintains, and operates provincial observation wells, collects and analyzes groundwater data, and shares data through public platforms. The program supports water management, policy decisions, and public awareness through the collection of this data. Key stakeholders include government agencies, Indigenous communities, researchers, and local governments.","Government Monitoring"
