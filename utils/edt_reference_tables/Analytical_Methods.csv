"1212","Pot. Tit. SA pH 4.5/4.2","Alkalinity is determined by potentiometric titration with sulfuric acid which has been standardized with sodium carbonate.  The sample (if pH>8.3) is first titrated to a pH=8.3, which corresponds to the equivalence point for the conversion of carbonate to bicarbonate ion (phenolphthalein alkalinity).  The titration is continued to a pH of 4.5, which corresponds approximately to the equivalence point for the conversion of bicarbonate ion to carbonic acid (entire titration indicates total alkalinity).  An extrapolation technique based on the near proportionality of concentration of hydrogen ions to excess of titrant beyond the equivalence point.  The amount of standard acid required to reduce pH exactly 0.30 pH (i.e. pH 4.2) unit is measured carefully.  Because this change in pH corresponds to an exact coupling of the hydrogen ion concentration, a simple extrapolation can be made to the equivalence point.  The actual pH of the stoichiometric end point in alkalinity determinations is the pH at which the inflection in the titration curve occurs and is directly related to the amount of carbonate alkalinity orginally present in the sample.  A curve can be constructed by plotting pH versus mL of acid to find this point directly.  To obtain the actual substances contributing to alkalinity, such a curve should be constructed.","EMS Migration","Alkalinity pH 4.5/4.2 (fl. conc.)"

After the cations are separated they exit at various times from the column in a background of eluent.  A self regenerating membrane suppressor is attached to the end of the column to neutralize the acid before detection and form the corresponding hydroxide. Note that ammonium is reported as NH4 not as N.  
(c) For HiVol samples, discs cut from the HiVol filter are extracted with DI water and the soluble anions are analyzed by IC.  Intermediate results are reported in units of mg/L and HiVol loading results are reported as ug/m3.

The hydrogen cyanide is subsequently reacted with chloramine-T to form cyanogen chloride which reacts with pyridine and barbituric acid to form a red coloured complex which is measured colorimetrically at 570nm.  Interferences are eliminated or reduced to a minimum by the on-line distillation procedure.

"AA07","Auto.Pyridine-Barbituric - low level","The sample is distilled from a phosphoric acid medium into a phosphate buffer solution (pH 5.2).  Simple cyanides, eg,. those that distill from the phosphoric acid solution without any ultraviolet irradiation, are absorbed into the phosphate buffer solution after distillation.  The cyanide in the buffer solution is converted to cyanogen chloride, (CNCI) by reaction with chloramine-T.  The CNCI then forms a red coloured complex on addition of the pyridine-barbituric acid reagent and the absorbance is measured at 580 nm.  The Konig (1,2) synthesis first described the specific and quantitative reaction of cyanogen halides to cleave pyridine to produce glutaconic aldehyde.  This reaction has been applied to the determination of cyanide by oxidation of CN- to cyanogen halide, CNX, in which CN+ is the reactive species.  The CN+ reacts with pyridine to produce an intermediate which hydrolyzes to a conjugated dialdehyde, glutaconic aldehyde.  The glutaconic aldehyde is then coupled with a primary amine, of a compound containing reactive methylene hydrogens (RH2), barbituric acid in this case (3).","EMS Migration","Cyanide WAD (fl. conc.)"

APPLICATION: This method determines the activity of bacterial populations in water, including drinking water, surface water (ponds, lakes, creeks etc.), raw water, ground water, wastewater, swimming pools and whirlpools. PRINCIPLE: Aliquots of water samples are inoculated in Biological Activity Reaction Test (BART?) vials specific to the desired organism type and incubated for eight days at room temperature. The reaction pattern is observed each day of the incubation period to determine the community activity and characteristics. Each vial type contains selective culture media specific to enriching and isolating the desired microbial community and therefore a different reaction pattern. The concentration, as colony forming unit per millilitre (cfu/mL), of the bacterial population can be extrapolated from the activity level based on the time delay for when a positive reaction is first observed in the reaction vial.

"BRAW","CRC ICPMS - run RAW for Br and I: unfiltered: unpreserved","This method is applicable to water samples as well as digests of solid samples with the exception of Br and I which is only applicable to un-digested un-preserved water samples. Water samples are analyzed for dissolved metals following sample filtration or for total metals following sample preservation or digestion with the exception of water samples for Bromine and Iodine which does not require any sample preparation and only cold preservation.         This method describes the multi-elemental determination of trace elements by Collision/Reaction Cell (CRC) ICP-MS. Ions produced by radio-frequency inductively coupled plasma are measured. Analyte species originating in a liquid are pneumatically nebulized and the resulting aerosol transported by argon gas into the plasma torch. The ions produced are entrained in the plasma gas and extracted, by means of a differentially pumped vacuum interface, into a mass spectrometer. The ions flow through a Collision/Reaction Cell (CRC) where, depending on the mode of analysis, they either pass through the cell unhindered (no gas - classical ICP-MS mode) or collision/reaction chemistry takes place between the ions and an introduced gas such as hydrogen or helium. The ions are then sorted according to their mass-to-charge ratios by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The ions transmitted through the quadrupole are quantified by a channel electron multiplier and the ion information is processed by a data handling system. Although most polyatomic interferences are removed, any additional interferences must be assessed and valid corrections applied or the data flagged to indicate problems. Interference correction must include compensation for background ions contributed by the plasma gas, reagents, and constituents of the sample matrix. Instrument drift as well as suppression or enhancement of instrument response caused by the sample matrix must be corrected for by the use of internal standards.","EMS Migration","Bromide Extractable (fl. conc.)"

The sample is manually homogenized, dried at 60 degrees Celsius, sieved through a 63 um (230 mesh) sieve, and a representative subsample of the dry material is weighed.  The sample is then digested at 95 degrees Celsius for 2 hours by block digester using concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids.  Instrumental analysis is by  atomic absorption spectrophotometry (EPA Method 245.7). Method Limitation: This method is not a total digestion technique.  It is a very strong acid digestion that is intended to dissolve those metals that may be environmentally available.  By design, elements bound in silicate structures are not normally dissolved by this procedure as they are not usually mobile in the environment. Deviation from Reference Method: This procedure deviates from the BC CSR SALM method, which specifies sieving to 2 mm (10 mesh).","EMS Migration","Mercury Total (mass conc.)"

The mercury is then purged from the solution with argon gas and passes through an atomic fluorescence detector where it absorbs light from a mercury vapour lamp that fluoresces at 254 nm. This is detected and amplified by a photo-multiplier tube in the detector.

"DNPA","DNPH + HPLC","Ambient air is drawn through a pre-packed silica gel cartridge coated with acidified 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) reagent, at a sampling rate of 500 - 1200 mL/min.  Aldehydes and ketones readily form a stable derivative with DNPH reagent.  These derivatives are analyzed using HPLC.  This method uses a coated adsorbent for sampling formaldehyde.  The reaction of organic carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) with DNPH-coated cartridges in the presence of acid, forms a stable derivative.  The sampling method gives a time weighted average and can be used for a 1 - 24 hours ambient air sampling time where the concentration of formaldehyde is in the low ppb (1 - 20 v/v) range or for short term (5 - 60 min) of source-impacted atmosphere where the concentration is in the ppm range.  Sampling flow rate is limited to 1.5 L/min because of the high pressure drop across the DNPH-coated silica gel cartridges.

Under basic conditions, ammonia reacts with phenol and is oxidized by sodium hypochlorite to form an organic complex, indophenol blue.  The blue colour formed is intensified with sodium nitroprusside, and the absorbance of the resulting complex is measured at 630 nm.

Static Headspace is sometimes referred to as Equilibrium Headspace because the vapour phase above the sample in a sealed vial is brought into thermodynamic equilibrium with the sample prior to analysis.  Volatile organic compounds are thermally extracted from the sample matrix by Static Headspace sampling and introduced directly to a thick-film megabore GC column.  Compounds eluting from the GC column are introduced into a Mass Spectrometer and target compounds are identified by a comparison of both retention times and mass spectra with those of reference standards stored in a computerized data system.  Reference retention times and mass spectra for analytes are obtained by the measurement of calibration standards under precisely the same extraction conditions used for samples.  The concentration of each identified component is measured by relating the response of the sample quantitation mass ions to the response of the quantitation mass ions of a series of external standards.

"F022","SAOB:Selective Ion Electrode","Sulfide ion is measured potentiometrically using a sulfide ion-selective electrode in conjuction with a double-junction, sleeve type reference electrode.  Potentials are read using a pH metre having an expanded millivolt scale capable of being read to the nearest 0.1 mV.  Samples are treated prior to analysis with sulfide anti-oxidant buffer (SAOB).  This buffer fixes the solution pH at a highly alkaline level, and contains ascorbic acid to retard air oxidation of sulfide ion in solution.  This ensures that sulfide present occurs chiefly as S= ion rather than as complexed HS- or H2S which are present at lower pH values.  The sulfide ion concentration is measured indirectly by observing the silver ion activity in the sample.  (Because of the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide, if either ion is present in a solution the other is absent.)  A minute quantity of silver ions is released to the sample from the solid silver sulfide membrane of the electrode.  These ions set up a potential with the silver ions in the internal reference solution.  The silver ion activity in the sample is dependent on the sulfide ion activity in the sample.  The relationships of the two ion activities is: E = Eb - 2.3* RT/nF* log As  (where E=measured total potential of the system; Eb=the portion of the total potential due to the reference electrode and its filling solution; As=the activity of the sulfide ion in the sample; 2.3* RT/nF=Nernst factor)  The potential (E) for each standard is plotted linearly against concentration on a log scale to produce a standard curve.","EMS Migration","Sulfide Total (fl. conc.)"

The amount of oxidizable organic matter is proportional to the potassium dichromate consumed.  Silver sulfate is added as a catalyst so that refractory organics such as acetic acid, which are biologically available to stream organisms, are included in the oxidation.  With the catalyst, other compounds such as cellulose, which are not part of the immediate biochemical load, are also included.  Any relationships among COD and BOD or any other tests are fortuitous, because condition of the test tend to give results indicating the susceptibility of a given sample to oxidation under specified conditions that are different for each test.

The Nitrite that is originally present in the sample plus the reduced Nitrate then react with sulphanilamide under acidic conditions to form a diazo compound.  This compound then complexes with N-1-naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride to form a reddish-purple azo dye, the absorbance of which is measured at 550 nm.

Compounds are then extracted from the cartridge by eluting with an acidic aqueous solvent.  The eluate is injected into a HPLC for separation and quantification is achieved by measuring absorbance at 308nm for Diquat and 258nm for Paraquat.","EMS Migration","Diquat (fl. conc.)"
"F124","UV Spectrophotometric Screen","Measurement of Nitrate is accomplished by the preparation of Nitrate standards in the range of 0-7mg/L-NO3-N.  Determination of sample nitrate concentration is accomplished by reading the UV absorbance of the sample at a wavelength at 220nm and at 275nm to determine interference.  A standard curve is constructed by plotting the absorbances due to NO3 conc. of standards.  Using the corrected sample absorbances, sample concentrations are obtained directly from the curve.","EMS Migration","Nitrate (NO3) Dissolved (fl. conc.)"
"F126","UV Measurements of DOC","This procedure is used to estimate the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in waters and wastewaters. Some organic compounds regularly found in waters have strong UV absorptions. Thus there is a strong relationship between the UV absorption and the organic carbon content of the water. DOC is usually measured at 254nm, though other wavelengths are often chosen to minimize any interference in the sample. In this method an absorption scan of 250nm, 254nm, 310nm, 340nm, 360nm, and 365nm is read. In an average sample the absorption should decrease with the increase of the wavelength. However, irregularities in this trend could indicate some source of UV absorbing interference.","EMS Migration","UV Absorbance 340nm (app.)"

Freeze-dried samples are ground in a Braun blender before being weighed into Teflon PFA liners and digested with concentrated nitric, concentrated hydrochloric and 30% hydrogen peroxide in a microwave oven; which results in a complete sample dissolution.  Samples are cooled and volumized with Type I water.  The digestion in a mixture of acids using microwave digestion techniques result in the complete extraction of selenium from tissues.  Analysis is performed via a graphite furnace atomic absorption (GFAA) technique, using Zeeman background correction system.  GFAA Spectroscopy involves heating the sample in 3 or more stages.  First, a low current heats the graphite tube to dry the sample.  The second, or charring stage, destroys organic matter and volatilizes other components at an intermediate temperature.  Finally, a high current heats the tube to incandescence and, in an inert atmosphere, atomizes the element being determined.  Additional stages may be added to aid in drying and charring, and to clean and cool the tube between samples.  The resultant ground-state atomic vapour absorbs monochromatic radiation from the source.  A photoelectric detector measures the intensity of transmitted radiation characteristic of the Se  or Sb absorption wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the quantity (concentration) of ground-state atoms in the optical path over a limited range.","EMS Migration","Selenium Total (mass conc.)"

"FQ01","Hydrocarbons&Petroleum Products ID screening","Flame ionization capillary gas chromatography is the primary means used for determining and matching the type of hydrocarbons present.  Initial screening and all ""high-boiling"" hydrocarbons (those having a boiling range greater than or equal to diesel fuel) are analysed using a bonded-phase polymethyl/phenyl siloxane GC column.  All ""low-boiling"" hydrocarbons (those having a boiling range less than diesel fuel) are preferably analysed using a bonded-phase polymethyl siloxane GC column.  Identification is based on the recognition and matching of peak patterns in the chromatogram and comparison with those produced by ""source"" samples or commercial petroleum hydrocarbons standards.  The distribution and relative concentrations of the components are considered unique to a given oil.  The carbon range is determined by comparing the sample with a commercial ""n-C5"" to ""n-C40"" hydrocarbon calibration mix.  Infrared spectrophotometry (IR) is used to confirm a hydrocarbon sample as either a petroleum or vegetable-animal in origin.  The spectrum is examined for the presence or absence of a strong carbonyl absorption at about 1740 cm-1.  The absence of this peak is good evidence for a petroleum origin of the sample.  The spectrum can also be compared to that of other hydrocarbon standards.  Ultraviolet/Visible spectrophotometry (UV/Vis) is used to determine the theoretical ratio of the aromatic compounds containing 2 rings to those containing 3 or more rings.  Trace metals present in the sample are examined by ICP emission spectroscopy.  The Nickel-Vanadium ratio can be a good indicator when used for non-distillate petroleum hydrocarbons, however, ""profile matching"" of the concentrations of selected metals is generally more useful.  Note: Results from this test are non-numeric and therefore are reported in the comment field.","EMS Migration","Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) (unitless)"

Analysis is then performed via Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GF-AAS) (low level analysis).
GFAA Spectrometry involves heating the sample in three or more stages.  First, a low current heats the graphite tube to dry the sample.  The second, or charring stage, destroys the organic matter and volatilizes other components at an intermediate temperature.  Finally, a high current heats the tube to incandescence and, in an inert atmosphere, atomizes the element being determined.

"FS84","SAOB: Selective Ion Electrode","Sulfide ion is measured potentiometrically using a sulfide ion-selective electrode in conjuction with a double-junction, sleeve type reference electrode.  Potentials are read using a pH metre having an expanded millivolt scale capable of being read to the nearest 0.1 mV.  Samples are treated prior to analysis with sulfide anti-oxidant buffer (SAOB).  This buffer fixes the solution pH at a highly alkaline level, and contains ascorbic acid to retard air oxidation of sulfide ion in solution.  This ensures that sulfide present occurs chiefly as S= ion rather than as complexed HS- or H2S which are present at lower pH values.  The sulfide ion concentration is measured indirectly by observing the silver ion activity in the sample.  (Because of the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide, if either ion is present in a solution the other is absent.)  A minute quantity of silver ions is released to the sample from the solid silver sulfide membrane of the electrode.  These ions set up a potential with the silver ions in the internal reference solution.  The silver ion activity in the sample is dependent on the sulfide ion activity in the sample.  The relationships of the two ion activities is: E = Eb - 2.3* RT/nF* log As  (where E=measured total potential of the system; Eb=the portion of the total potential due to the reference electrode and its filling solution; As=the activity of the sulfide ion in the sample; 2.3* RT/nF=Nernst factor)  The potential (E) for each standard is plotted linearly against concentration on a log scale to produce a standard curve.","EMS Migration","Sulfide Total (mass conc.)"

The ions flow through a Collision/Reaction Cell (CRC) where depending on the mode of analysis either the ions passes through the cell unhindered (no gas - classical ICP-MS mode), or collisions/reactions chemistry takes place between the ions and a neutral gas such as hydrogen or helium. Any polyatomic ions which give interference on the analytes are removed. The ions are then sorted according to their mass-to-charge ratios by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The ions are then sorted according to their mass-to-charge ratios by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The ions transmitted through the quadrupole are quantified by a channel electron multiplier and the ion information processed by a data handling system. Although most polyatomic interference is removed, any additional interference must be assessed and valid corrections applied or the data flagged to indicate problems. Interference correction must include compensation for background ions contributed by the plasma gas, reagents, and constituents of the sample matrix. Instrument drift as well as suppressions or enhancements of instrument response caused by the sample matrix must be corrected for by the use of internal standards.","EMS Migration","Sulfur Total (fl. conc.)"

"NCEM","Total Nitrogen Chemiluminescence","To determine the quantity of combustible Total Nitrogen in water, the aqueous sample is injected into a combustion furnace with a temperature of greater than 700oC (with a catalyst).  The nitrogen is converted to NO.  The carrier gas sweeps the NO to the nitrogen module where NO is mixed with ozone and then forms NO2 in its excited state.  When NO2 in its excited state returns to ground state, extra energy is given off as light.  This phenomenon is called chemiluminescence.  This light is then quantified using a chemiluminescence detector that is attached to the Apollo 9000 HS instrument.","EMS Migration","Nitrogen Total (fl. conc.)"

A sample is injected in a matrix matched carrier which is then mixed with a sodium hydroxide solution to convert the free ammonium into ammonia gas. After mixing, this basic solution is pushed through a dialysis PTFE membrane to the receiver OPA solution which then reacts to form the fluorescent derivative. This reaction is further increased (Intensified) by passing through a 62 degree inline reaction loop which then is detected and quantified using an inline fluorescent detector. This method is applicable for the measurement of ammonium in drinking water, ground water, and can be acceptable for brackish waters.","EMS Migration","Nitrogen Ammonia Total (fl. conc.)"

A revised version of this method has been developed specifically for pulp and paper effluents; EPS 1/RM/59; March 2018. This method is specific for the pH controller technique described in EPS 1/RM/50 as an add on to the acute fish toxicity test; EPS 1/RM/13.  Method Summary Rainbow Trout are exposed in single or multiple concentration(s) of the sample and mortality is recorded over a period of 96 hours at 15?1?C. The pass/fail single concentration test uses undiluted material at 100% concentration and determines the percent mortality after 96 hours. The LC50 and LC20 tests use multiple concentrations of material diluted in laboratory water and determines the concentration of that is lethal to 50% and 20% of the test fish respectively. Parallel testing with and without pH stabilization is recommended to demonstrate the presence of ammonia toxicity.  Upward pH drift in the effluent test solution causes an increase in the concentration of un-ionized ammonia which is the most acutely toxic form present. The loss of CO2 is caused by the standard test procedure of aerating the effluent sample with lab air. The pH stabilization is intended to replace the CO2 lost during aeration in order to maintain the pH throughout the test at the same level found in the original sample. The pH stabilization is accomplished by using either the CO2 injection or the pH controller techniques. The procedure is only applicable when used explicitly with conjunction to the reference method EPS 1/RM/13 ?Biological Test Method: Reference Method for Determining Acute Lethality of Effluents to Rainbow Trout?. The pH stabilization applies to both single and multiple concentration tests.  Applications For use only with wastewater effluents. The LC50 test is required for permitted discharges.","EMS Migration","Rainbow Trout Bioassay (Pass/Fail) (mortality) (ratio)"

"SBCM","Salinity by Conductivity Method","Salinity in Water  PURPOSE/PRINCIPLE OF METHOD: There are two definitions of the term salinity, absolute salinity and practical salinity.  Absolute salinity is defined as the ratio of the mass of dissolved material in seawater to the mass of the seawater. This salinity cannot be measured directly and thus the practical salinity value has been adopted as the standard for reporting salinity values. Practical salinity is defined as the ratio of the electrical conductivity of a sample to that of a standard potassium chloride (KCl) solution at the same temperature and pressure. The salinity dependence of the conductivity ratio as a function of temperature of a given sample to a standard S=35 seawater sample is used to determine the salinity. In water, ions such as calcium, magnesium, sodium bicarbonate, nitrate, phosphate, iron, and sulphate all contribute to the salinity. Conductivity accounts for all ions in solution and provides no specific information regarding the type and concentration of any particular ion. Instead, a reading proportional to the combined effect of all ions is reported. SCOPE: Salinity is an important unitless property of industrial and natural waters. Because of its high sensitivity and ease of measurement, the conductivity method is most commonly used to determine salinity.

Reference Method: Application Note, Elementar Form No. AN-A-030609-E-01, CNS analysis in soil with the vario EL Cube SECTION 1: Introduction  The Vario El Cube is an elemental analyzer that uses a thermal conductivity detector to determine Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Sulfur in a soil sample. The thermal conductivity detector contains two chambers, one measuring cell for the analysis gas and a reference cell for the carrier gas. Both gases will flow through the cell during analysis. The gases will mix and cause a difference in electrical charge which is measured by a microcontroller. The microcontroller will convert and integrate the electrical signal into a digitized one. The signal is displayed as a measuring peak dependent on the time. The elemental content of the sample will be calculated from the integrals of the individual measuring peaks and the calibration factors of the elements.   SECTION 2: Scope  This procedure is applicable to the determination of Carbon, Organic Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Sulphur in solids.  SECTION 3: Reporting Detection Limits  Total Nitrogen: 0.20% Total Carbon: 0.02% Total Organic Carbon: 0.02%  Total Sulfur: 0.03%  SECTION 4: Interferences  4.1 All samples are to be dried and ground as per AB SOP-00035: Grinding of Soil Samples to ensure all moisture is removed. During analysis the sample gas passes through reagent tubes containing anhydrone (magnesium perchlorate) to remove any water vapor produced during combustion.  4.2 Some samples may react strongly when the HCL is added which could cause a loss of sample. If this occurs a dilution must be done and the acid must be added drop by drop. SECTION 5: Sample Hold Time and Preservation  No specific holding time is stated in the reference method. It is Maxxam?s policy to discard samples 60 days after analysis. No preservation required, store dry samples at ambient Temperature.","EMS Migration","Carbon Total Organic (ratio)"

Gas Chromatographic Method Principle: This gas chromatographic procedure may be usedto determine the individual concentrations of the following fattyacids: acetic; propionic; butyric; isobutyric; valeric; andisovaleric acids in digester sludge samples. Caproic and heptanoicacids also may be determined; but with less certaintybecause of their reduced solubility in water. Volatile fatty acidsare generally soluble in digester sludge and exist in either theprotonated or unprotonated form; depending on the pH of thesludge sample. Acetic and propionic acids usually are in higherconcentrations than the other fatty acids in digester sludge. Allacids must be converted to the protonated (volatile) form beforeinjection into the gas chromatograph (GC) so vaporization mayoccur. The fatty acids must also be separated from the solidsmaterial in the sample before introduction into the GC to minimizedegradation of the GC column. Digester sludge samples areprepared by acidification; centrifugation; and filtration.

"X160","Auto Molybdate-Blue Col.(Ascorbic)","Not all forms of silica in solution will react to give the silicomolybdate complex.  Silicic acid readily polymerizes at the pH of seawater (pH=8.0), and only straight chain polymers of relatively short length will react with molybdate at any appreciable speed.  Therefore, the term ""Reactive Silica"" is best used.  This automated procedure for the determination of reactive silica is based on the reduction by ascorbic acid of silicomolybdate in acidic solution to heteropoly blue.  The colour is measured at 660 nm in a 1.5 cm cell.  Oxalic acid is introduced to the sample stream before the addition of ascorbic acid to eliminate interference from phosphates.  The sample should be collected in a clean linear polyethylene bottle.  The samples are not preserved.  The samples should be free from turbidity.  Allow the samples to settle before decanting an aliquot, or filter the samples through 0.45 m filter paper.  Samples are stored at 4C prior to analysis.  The samples should be analysed within 28 days.  Note: Do not use glass containers.","EMS Migration","Silica Reactive Diss (fl. conc.)"

"X171","Carbon Anal.:Infra Red","Analysis is comprised of 2 phases, the determination of Total Carbon (TC) or Dissolved Carbon (DC) and the determination of Total Inorganic Carbon (TIC) or Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC).  Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content, or Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) is then calculated by difference.  A series of External Standard solutions, Potassium Biphthalate for TC (DC) and Sodium Carbonate/Sodium Bicarbonate for TIC (DIC) is used for instrument calibration.  During TC (DC) analysis, a small portion of the sample (or standard) solution is introduced into a combustion tube, containing a Platinum catalyst at an elevated temperature with an Oxygen gas carrier, via an automated autosampler/injector.  The sample's TC (DC) component is combusted/oxidized to form CO2.  The CO2 flows through an IC reaction vessel, is cooled and dried by an electronic dehumidifier and passes through a halogen scrubber into a Non-dispersive Infrared Detector (NDIR).  The NDIR produces an analog signal over a constant time base that a data processor converts into a peak, the area of which is proportional to the TC concentration of the sample.  The TC (DC) concentration of a sample is determined electronically from a calibration curve expressing the relationship between the peak area of a standard and its concentration.  Similarly, for the TIC (DIC) phase of the analysis, another small portion of sample (or standard) solution is introduced directly into the IC reaction vessel, containing a Phosphoric Acid solution through which carrier gas is bubbled.

The GAC from each column is separately pyrolysed at high temperature in a controlled atmosphere and the resulting ""HX"" gases are purged through a dehydrating tube into a Chlorine Detection Cell, automatically kept at a preset potential, where the sample is trapped in an Acetic Acid electrolyte and microcoulometrically titrated with silver ions.

"X383","Extr: GC/MS or GC/ECD","Determination of Polychloriated Biphenyls (PCBs) In Soil by GC/ECD.  PURPOSE/PRINCIPLE OF METHOD: This document details the requirements and procedures for the analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in soil by gas chromatography  electron capture detector (GC/ECD).  A homogenized soil sample is extracted using dichloromethane (DCM). The extract may be cleaned up using column chromatography with 2% Deactivated Florisil. When contamination with sulphur is suspected, further cleanup using copper is required. Analysis is performed using a GC/ECD.  Similar methods have been developed for other matrices including waste and transformer oils, water, swabs, florisil tubes, biota. Generally, the sample extraction procedures differ while the GC analysis methods are similar or identical for all matrices. SCOPE: This procedure describes the determination of PCBs in soil and sediments. Other materials such as wood waste may also be analyzed by this method.  DETECTION LIMITS: Target Compound Reported Detection Limit (mg/g) Arochlor 1242 0.03, Arochlor 1248 0.03, Arochlor 1254 0.03, Arochlor 1260 0.03, INTERFERENCES: Interferences (e.g. co-eluting peaks on the chromatogram) may be due to sulphur, phthalate esters, or from chlorinated compounds. Suspect samples must be reanalyzed using appropriate cleanup steps.

The SO2 analyzer measures sulfur dioxide concentrations using the principle of fluorescence of the SO2 molecule.  SO2 molecules are irradiated by light in the far-ultraviolet (UV) region and fluorescence with a secondary emission, also in the UV region.  This secondary emission gives off a light output that is proportional to the concentration of sulfur dioxide molecules present.","EMS Migration","Total Reduced Sulfur (air conc.)"

Using a vacuum pump, an acidified homogenized sample is filtered through a glass fiber filter, then through sodium bismuthate into a vial containing the trivalent manganese solution. The glass fiber filter traps solids and is removed from the filter and placed into the MnIII vial. The capped vial is digested at 150 degrees C for 1 hour. As the MnIII oxidizes the organics present in the sample, the purple color of the MnIII solution decreases, becoming clear when all MnIII has been reduced. The COD concentration is proportional to the decrease in the purple color of the solution. COD is determined colorimetrically at 510 nm using a calibration curve from potassium hydrogen phthalate standards.","EMS Migration","Chemical Oxygen Demand (fl. conc.)"

A clear (Total) or filtered (Dissolved) water sample is injected into a stream of carbonate-bicarbonate eluent and passed through a series of ion exchanger.  The anions of interested are separated on the basis of their relative affinities for a low capacity , strongly basic anion exchanger (guard and separate columns).  The separated anions are directed through the anion self-regenerating suppressor (ASRS).  Hydronium ions in the suppressor will neutralize the eluent to its weakly ionized form and convert the separated anions in their conductive acid form.  The separated anions are measured by conductivity.  They are identified on the basis of retention time as compared to standards.  Quantitation is by measurement of peak area of peak height against a calibration curve generated from known standards.","EMS Migration","Bromide Dissolved (fl. conc.)"
